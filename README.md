## Part 1
`part1.py` is the file that contains the script for completing part 1. The actual database operations are defined in `Database.py`. `DbConnector.py` is the python connector. **It is assumed that the `dataset` is in the root directory!**
## Part 2
`part2.py` is the file that contains the script for solving the problems for part 2. Each function is one solution and are executed at the bottom of the file.
